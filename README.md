## Abstract
Abstract: Energy prices constitute a major subject of political discourse and intervention. The cost of electricity impacts not only households but also heavily electricity-dependent industries. This paper seeks to assess the influence of electricity price fluctuations on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). To achieve this, we analyze data from 2010 to 2019 for 5,566 counties in Brazil, a nation where over 60% of its electricity is generated from hydropower. To isolate the impact of political intervention and business cycles, we employ rainfall as an instrumental variable for electricity pricing. Our argument posits that rainfall indirectly affects manufacturing GDP exclusively through its influence on electricity costs. Our estimations reveal that a 1% increase in electricity prices corresponds to an average decrease of 0.25823% in manufacturing GDP per capita.
